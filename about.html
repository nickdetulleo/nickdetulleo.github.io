			<h2>About This Project</h2>
			<p>The vibrant and colorful murals that adorn the walls of Philadelphia are not just a source of aesthetic pleasure, but they also tell a story of the city's cultural and social history. The mural-making tradition in Phiadelphia dates back to the early 20th century, but it gained momentum in the 1980s as a response to the city's growing urban blight and the need to revitalize neglected neighborhoods. Today, Philadelphia is home to over 4,000 murals, making it the mural capital of the world. These murals celebrate the city's diversity, history, and community spirit, and have become an iconic part of Philadelphia's cultural identity. From the poignant portraits of civil rights leaders to whimsical scenes of everyday life, the murals of Philadelphia are a testament to the power of public art and its ability to transform communities. </p>
